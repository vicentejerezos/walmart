This Dataset contains historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number 
of Departments and our goal is to correctly predict the weekly sales.

## PROJECT PLANNING 

1) Understand nature of the Data.
2) Histograms, Barplots, Lineplots, etc...
3) Value counts.
4) Missing Data.
5) Correlation between the metrics.
6) Important themes:

	6.1) Which store has the highest demand?
	6.2) Which department has the highest demand?
	6.3) Analyze annual sales.
	6.4) When was the highest demand? And the lowest?
	6.5) Is demand higher during holidays or during week days?
	6.6) What is the largest store? Are sales and size related somehow?
	6.7) If we had the costs, we could estimate the company's profitability.

7) Feature engineering.
8) Outliers.
9) Skew.
10) Scaling.
11) Model performance:
	11.1) Linear Regression.
	11.2) Random Forest.
	11.3) Decision Tree.
	11.4) Keras regression.

12) Compare model performance.
13) Obtain results.
